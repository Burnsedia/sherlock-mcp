# Mission: Finding Truth Through Ethical OSINT

## Our Purpose

In a world increasingly shaped by digital narratives and social media influence, the Sherlock MCP Server exists to empower truth-seekers, investigators, and journalists with transparent, verifiable tools for open-source intelligence gathering. We believe that technology should serve the pursuit of truth, not obscure it.

## Core Principles

### 🔍 **Truth-Seeking Through Transparency**

We commit to open-source development, allowing community scrutiny of our methods and algorithms. Transparency builds trust and enables collective improvement of investigative tools.

- Respect for privacy and individual rights
- Compliance with platform terms and legal requirements
- Focus on public information only

We specifically target the challenges of modern disinformation:

- **Account Verification**: Systematically check username consistency across platforms
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify coordinated campaigns and artificial amplification
- **Source Credibility**: Provide tools to assess account legitimacy and posting patterns
- **Narrative Analysis**: Support cross-platform investigation of information spread
